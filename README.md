Air Quality Analysis (Kaggle Dataset 2015-2020)
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of air quality data from 2015 to 2020 using the Kaggle dataset. The project aims to explore historical air quality trends, identify pollution levels, and assess contributing factors like traffic and weather patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes air quality data from multiple regions, with pollutants such as:

PM2.5
PM10
NO2
SO2
O3
CO
Source: Kaggle Air Quality Dataset (2015-2020).

Objectives
Analyze air quality data over time, identifying trends and seasonal variations.
Investigate the causes of pollution spikes.
Compare air quality across different cities/regions.
Present insights through visualizations in Python, Power BI, and Tableau.
Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Power BI: Dashboards and reports
Tableau: Data visualizations
Jupyter Notebooks: For data analysis and visualization in Python
Key Insights
Seasonal Trends: Identified seasonal variations in pollutant levels, with spikes during winter months.
Pollution Levels: Detailed breakdown of AQI levels across cities.
Potential Causes: Analysis of correlations between pollution levels and traffic, weather patterns, and industrial activity.
Comparative Analysis: Comparison of air quality across various cities and regions.
