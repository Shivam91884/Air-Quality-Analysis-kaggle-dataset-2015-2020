Air Quality Analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Air Quality Analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze historical air quality data, identify trends, and investigate the factors contributing to pollution levels in different regions.

Project Overview
Air pollution is a critical issue in many parts of the world. In this project, we focus on understanding the variations in air quality over time and across different locations. The dataset includes key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2, and we aim to find seasonal patterns, pollution spikes, and potential causes like traffic or weather conditions. The analysis compares air quality across cities/regions, providing insights for further research or policy-making.

Key Objectives:
Analyze seasonal trends in air quality
Identify pollution spikes and possible contributing factors
Compare pollution levels between different cities/regions
Visualize findings using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, and Tableau

Dataset:
The dataset consists of historical Air Quality Index (AQI) data with detailed pollutant information:
-PM2.5
-PM10
-NO2
-SO2
-Data Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india 

Tools & Technologies:
Python: For data manipulation and visualization using libraries like:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards
